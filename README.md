# WebGL Hosting Fix Pack
Generated by **Unity → HTML5 Studio**
https://unity-html5-studio-v3.vercel.app

## What this pack does
This pack helps prevent common Unity WebGL hosting failures by configuring:
- Correct **Content-Encoding** for precompressed assets (.br / .gz)
- Correct **MIME type** for WebAssembly (.wasm)
- Recommended **caching** headers for /Build assets
- Adds **Vary: Accept-Encoding** for safer CDN/proxy caching

## Your scan summary
- Brotli detected: **No**
- Gzip detected: **No**
- Quick score: **25/100**
- Memory hints found: **No**

## Choose your hosting platform
### Vercel
1. Copy `vercel.json` into your project root
2. Deploy
3. Verify that requests for `*.wasm.br` return headers:
   - Content-Encoding: br
   - Content-Type: application/wasm
   - Vary: Accept-Encoding

### Netlify
1. Put the included `_headers` file in your publish directory (or repo root if it’s your publish dir).
2. Deploy

### Nginx
1. Merge rules from `nginx.conf` into your server block
2. Reload nginx

### Apache
1. Place `.htaccess` in the web root (same folder as index.html)

## Troubleshooting
- If your build loads locally but fails online, it’s usually **encoding** or **wasm MIME**.
- If you see errors like "Unexpected token" on .wasm/.data, headers are likely wrong.
- If a CDN/proxy behaves oddly, ensure **Vary: Accept-Encoding** is present for compressed assets.
- If load is slow, ensure /Build files are cached with "immutable".
